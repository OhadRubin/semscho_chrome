## Installation
1. Download semscho_chrome_v1.0.zip

2. Open the Google Chrome browser.

Click on the three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top-right corner of the browser window, and then navigate to "More tools" > "Extensions."

In the Extensions page, enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.

Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode.

In the file explorer window that opens, navigate to the folder containing the manifest.json and contentScript.js files (e.g., citation-counter-extension). Select the folder and click "Open."

The extension should now be installed, and you should see it listed on the Extensions page in Chrome. You can start using it by browsing web pages. The extension will automatically append the citation counts to the names of people on the web page, as long as they have a Semantic Scholar page.
